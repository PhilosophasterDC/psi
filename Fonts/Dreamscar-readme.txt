Be afraid. Be VERY afraid. Dreamscar is as scary as they come! This display font, originally designed in 2001, gets a small facelift. Some of the glyphs have changed slightly while some have 
drastically. While the previous version was suggestive in nature the update comes complete with butcher's knives, chains, axes, and meat cleavers. Most of the lowercase letters are cloned with 
their uppercase counterparts. Punctuation is also very limited. Glyphs can be added with purchase of unlimited commercial license. 

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license.
If you've previously licensed the older version you're grandfathered into this version. Thank you! I also design custom fonts for businesses, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to 
leave me a donation you can use the same address via paypal. Your generosity will be most appreciated! Enjoy!
